# Unsupervised Machine Learning  
*(Erasmus @ Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria ‚Äî Spring 2024-2025)*

This repository contains my homework assignments for the **Unsupervised Machine Learning** course I completed during my Erasmus exchange at **JKU Linz**.  
The course provided both theoretical depth and hands-on experience in unsupervised learning techniques, covering probabilistic models, clustering, dimensionality reduction, latent variable models, and graphical models.  

The repository showcases my implementations, experiments, and analyses using these methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

## üéØ Course Overview

The **Unsupervised Machine Learning** course complements the lecture *Machine Learning: Unsupervised Techniques* and focuses on practicing the concepts and methods through programming assignments and small projects.

### Key Learning Goals
‚úÖ Understand the mathematical foundations and assumptions of unsupervised learning models.  
‚úÖ Implement algorithms for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and latent variable modeling.  
‚úÖ Apply these methods to real-world data and interpret the results.  
‚úÖ Gain practical experience with Python libraries for machine learning and data analysis.
